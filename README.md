# MoCk TeXt
Heavily (entirely) inspired by https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/uwu

Converts input from stdin to MoCkInG tExT.

# Goal
I saw [uwu](https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/uwu), and wanted to try an
play with simd instructions too. Also this uses rust const generics, so that is
pretty cool.


# Limitations
- ascii only, unicode is hard, also unchecked
